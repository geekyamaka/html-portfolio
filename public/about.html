<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Michelle Onwuka. I am currently 25 years old(2024). I have a
  Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering and a Master's Degree in Computer
  Science and Artificial Intelligence. I am looking to build a career in
  Software Engineering and I know it's going to be difficult but The Lord will
  help me, according to His Will and His riches in Glory.

<p>
  Did I mention that I am a Christian? Yes. I have been washed by the Blood of
  Jesus Christ and I believe in His coming, suffering, death and resurrection.
  This is the essence of my life; the center of it. The Gospel saves!
